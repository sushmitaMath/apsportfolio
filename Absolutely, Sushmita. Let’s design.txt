Absolutely, Sushmita. Let’s design this **step-by-step system** like a **business case**, **powered by CS + AI/ML**, that identifies **counterfeit products *before* customers see them** — even removing the need for brands like Apple to manually intervene.

## 💼 Business Case Title:

**Proactive Counterfeit Prevention System (PCPS)**
*“Catch fake listings before they go live – trusted by brands, powered by Amazon.”*

---

## 🎯 Core Objective:

Prevent fake products from being listed on Amazon by:

1. Detecting counterfeit products **at upload time**
2. Matching against real-brand product database
3. Giving full control to Amazon to **auto-block fakes**, removing brand dependence
4. Showing **real-time trust scores** to customers

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Flow + Detailed Algorithms

---

### 🔹 Step 1: **Seller Uploads Product (Image + Title + Description + Price)**

As soon as a product is uploaded, trigger automated inspection.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: **Image Matching Against Verified Database**

#### ✅ Use:

* **KD-Tree** on CNN feature vectors (e.g., ResNet/MobileNet)
* **LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing)** for faster nearest-neighbor matching

#### 🔍 Goal:

Find whether this image is visually similar to verified products or flagged fakes.

#### 🧠 How:

* Verified product images are embedded into vectors using CNN
* KD-tree stores them for fast image similarity search
* For scale, LSH buckets help in approximate matching

#### 🚀 Output:

> “90% similar to Apple iPhone 14, but logo alignment is suspicious.”

---

### 🔹 Step 3: **Textual Description & Title Verification**

#### ✅ Use:

* **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity**
* **MMI (Maximum Mutual Information)**
* **BERT-based sentence embeddings**

#### 🧠 How:

* Extract keywords from verified descriptions
* Compare uploaded product’s title/description
* MMI ensures low-information fakes get low scores (like “100% genuine super Applee iPhonex”)

#### 🚀 Output:

> “Title contains deceptive permutation: Aplpe iPhonex”

---

### 🔹 Step 4: **Seller Behavior Analysis**

#### ✅ Use:

* **PageRank** on Seller-Product Graph
* **Mo’s Algorithm** to track listing windows over time

#### 🧠 How:

* Sellers are nodes; products they list are edges
* PageRank finds central (possibly fake) sellers
* Mo’s algorithm helps query fast “how many listings in past 10 days?”

#### 🚀 Output:

> “This seller has 10 suspicious uploads in the past 3 days”

---

### 🔹 Step 5: **Product Authenticity Registry Lookup**

#### ✅ Use:

* **Hash Map of verified SKUs + Image/Text fingerprints**
* **Tries** for autocomplete matching with brand product names

#### 🧠 How:

* When a seller uploads a SKU, hash it and match with brand-signed hash
* For typosquatting (e.g., "Appl3"), use Tries to match common obfuscations

#### 🚀 Output:

> “SKU not in Apple-approved list. Possible forgery.”

---

### 🔹 Step 6: **Risk Scoring and Trustworthiness Engine**

#### ✅ Use:

* **XGBoost or LightGBM** (trained on labeled fake/genuine listings)
* **Min-Max normalization** for real-time UI score
* Features: image similarity, price anomaly, seller score, keyword deception, brand match confidence

#### 🚀 Output:

> “Risk Score = 92 (Fake); Confidence = High”

---

### 🔹 Step 7: **Enforcement Decision**

#### ✅ Use:

* **A* or Uniform Cost Search*\* if multiple review/validation queues exist (e.g., human review, auto-block, flag)

#### 🚀 Output:

> “Auto-blocked. Alert sent to brand. Human review skipped (score high).”

---

### 🔹 Step 8: **Real-Time Customer Trust Layer (UI)**

#### ✅ Use:

* Trust Score display (0-100)
* Tooltip: “This product verified directly by Apple, shipped by trusted seller”
* Optional: “Amazon Guarantee: 100% refund if counterfeit”

---

### 🔹 Step 9: **Brand-Amazon Smart API Control**

#### ✅ Use:

* **Fermat’s Little Theorem** for public-key crypto watermarking on verified product images/SKUs
* Brands pre-sign valid SKUs
* Amazon validates instantly, without bothering the brand

## 💻 Example Flow for a Suspicious Product Upload:

```txt
Seller uploads:
  - Product: “Appl3 iPhone14x Pro”
  - Price: ₹9,999
  - Image: iPhone with dimmed logo

System detects:
  - 89% match to Apple-verified image (KD-tree + ResNet)
  - 70% MMI match; obfuscated name
  - PageRank score of seller = low
  - SKU not in Apple registry

Final Score: 94 (High-Risk)
Action: Auto-blocked before being listed. Brand notified.
```
