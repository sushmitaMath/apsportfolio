That's a great question, Sushmita. **You should not add all these algorithms at once** — it can overwhelm the reader and dilute your core message.

Instead, you should **select one cohesive, powerful, and realistic solution** that showcases your **computer science expertise** and also **solves the problem in a way Amazon isn’t currently doing**.

## ✅ **Best Pick: Seller Trust Engine with Visual Counterfeit Detection Using KD-Tree + PageRank + ML**

This solution stands out because:

* It’s **scalable** and fits Amazon’s real-time needs.
* It uses **classical algorithms + modern ML** — ideal for a CS student applying to Amazon.
* It’s **more intelligent than Amazon’s current rule-based & manual review methods**.

### 💡 **Project Title: “TrustNet: A Visual-AI and Graph-Based System for Scalable Counterfeit Detection on Amazon”**

---

## 🎯 Problem You’re Solving

> Amazon struggles to catch counterfeit sellers quickly and at scale. Manual reviews and keyword/image flagging aren’t enough. Many fake products go undetected — especially when sellers use new accounts and slightly altered images.

---

## 🔍 Core Idea:

> You propose a hybrid system that builds a **"Seller Trust Score"** using graph-based influence (PageRank), behavior analytics, and visual similarity (KD-Tree + CNN). This score is used to **proactively detect and de-rank counterfeit listings** before they reach customers.

---

## 🛠️ **Your System Architecture:**

### **Step 1: Visual Fingerprinting of Product Images**

* Extract image features using a CNN (e.g., ResNet).
* Store image embeddings.
* Use **KD-Tree** for fast nearest-neighbor lookup when new products are uploaded.

> If a new listing is visually >90% similar to a flagged fake, it’s auto-flagged for review.

---

### **Step 2: Build the Seller Interaction Graph**

* Nodes = sellers
* Edges = shared reviews, return patterns, brand disputes, common delivery addresses, or buyer behavior
* Apply **PageRank** to compute influence/trust of sellers based on these interactions.

> Sellers who interact with fake-heavy clusters or low-trust accounts get a lower rank.

---

### **Step 3: ML-based Seller Behavior Scoring**

* Features:

  * Return rate
  * Complaint ratio
  * Category risk
  * Listing/image similarity count
  * Time since account creation
* Train an ML model (XGBoost / LightGBM) to predict risk score based on historical behavior of known counterfeiters.

> Output: `risk_score ∈ [0, 1]`

---

### **Step 4: Combine into Final Trust Score**

```
trust_score = 0.5 * (1 - visual_similarity_risk)
             + 0.3 * seller_PageRank
             + 0.2 * (1 - ML_risk_score)
```

> Thresholds decide what gets auto-blocked vs. sent for manual review.

## 📈 Benefits Over Amazon’s Current System:

| Feature                    | Amazon Today               | Your Proposed System             |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Visual Duplicate Detection | Basic pixel/image match    | AI-based similarity + KD-Tree    |
| Seller Reputation          | Manual audits + heuristics | PageRank-based influence + ML    |
| Detection Speed            | After complaints           | At upload time                   |
| Adaptability               | Static rules               | Self-learning with feedback loop |
| False Positives            | Higher                     | Reduced via multi-signal scoring |
