## 💡 Algorithm & AIML-Based Solutions

### **1. KD-Tree for Visual Similarity Detection**

* **Use case**: Quickly detect visually similar product images (fakes with minor edits).
* **How**: Extract image embeddings using a CNN → index them using **KD-Tree** → fast KNN search to find similar (possibly counterfeit) images.

> **Used For**: Duplicate product detection at scale using vector-based similarity.

---

### **2. PageRank Algorithm for Seller Trust Ranking**

* **Use case**: Evaluate and rank sellers based on interactions (reviews, refunds, authenticity claims).
* **How**: Treat sellers as nodes and verified interactions as edges; apply **PageRank** to identify central, reliable sellers.

> **Used For**: Assigning seller trust scores that are graph-theory-informed and resistant to manipulation.

---

### **3. Mo's Algorithm for Efficient Querying of Seller Activity Logs**

* **Use case**: Real-time querying over seller data logs (e.g., product returns, negative reviews).
* **How**: Use **Mo's Algorithm** to process range queries over large datasets like time series of sales or complaints efficiently.

> **Used For**: Fast analysis on behavioral patterns of sellers over time.

---

### **4. Uniform Cost Search / A\*** for Optimal Investigation Path

* **Use case**: Investigating counterfeit networks or optimizing inspection budget.
* **How**: Use **UCS/A\*** to traverse seller/product graphs minimizing cost to detect fakes, considering seller influence, category importance, etc.

> **Used For**: Prioritizing investigations in a cost-effective and impactful manner.

### **5. Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm to Cut Fake Supply Chains**

* **Use case**: Modeling supply chains where counterfeits "flow" through weak verification points.
* **How**: Use **Ford-Fulkerson** to find maximum fake flow from counterfeit source to Amazon’s platform and minimize it by cutting the path.

> **Used For**: Finding and disrupting counterfeit entry points programmatically.

---

### **6. Johnson–Trotter Algorithm for Generating Seller/Product Permutations**

* **Use case**: Simulation/testing all possible seller/product placements in recommendation/testing scenarios.
* **How**: Generate all permutations of a product listing or seller network efficiently using **Johnson–Trotter**.

> **Used For**: Simulation environments for recommendation system robustness.

---

### **7. Borůvka’s Algorithm for Regional Seller Clustering**

* **Use case**: Cluster sellers into trusted subnetworks (e.g., verified logistics chains).
* **How**: Use **Borůvka’s Algorithm** to construct minimum spanning forests for geographically or category-wise distributed seller groups.

> **Used For**: Regional trust cluster formation for supply chain traceability.

---

### **8. Fermat’s Little Theorem for Anti-Spoofing Verification Codes**

* **Use case**: Generate cryptographically secure authenticity tokens or QR codes.
* **How**: Use **Fermat’s Little Theorem** for modular exponentiation-based verification (modular inverse) of unique product codes.

> **Used For**: Low-cost on-chain/off-chain authenticity system for physical items.

---

### **9. MMI (Maximum Mutual Information) for Textual Claim Verification**

* **Use case**: Counterfeit product descriptions often have fake claims.
* **How**: Use **MMI** in an NLP model to measure mutual relevance between product description and brand/trusted sources.

> **Used For**: Identifying misleading or fake product content using generative + discriminative NLP.
